EXERCISE

8.1 You work for a furniture company, and you have to ship furniture
all over the country. You need to pack your truck with boxes. All
the boxes are of different sizes, and you’re trying to maximize the
space you use in each truck. How would you pick boxes to maximize
space? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the
optimal solution?

Solution
* Sort the items starting from high size to low size, pick items with the highest size to the ones with low size continously until items are exhausted or there is no space left in the truck. 
(Not optimal)

8.2 You’re going to Europe, and you have seven days to see everything
you can. You assign a point value to each item (how much you want to see it) and estimate how long it takes. How can you maximize the point total (seeing all the things you really want to see) during your stay? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the optimal solution?

Solution
* Sort the locations by highest points, start picking until you exhaust the days. (Not optimal)



For each of these algorithms, say whether it’s a greedy algorithm or not.

8.3 Quicksort
No
8.4 Breadth-first search
Yes
8.5 Dijkstra’s algorithm
Yes


8.6 A postman needs to deliver to 20 homes. He needs to find the
shortest route that goes to all 20 homes. Is this an NP-complete
problem?

Yes

8.7 Finding the largest clique in a set of people (a clique is a set of people
who all know each other). Is this an NP-complete problem?

Yes

8.8 You’re making a map of the USA, and you need to color adjacent
states with different colors. You have to find the minimum number
of colors you need so that no two adjacent states are the same color.
Is this an NP-complete problem?

Yes
