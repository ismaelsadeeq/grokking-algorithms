### Exercises

1.1 Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you’re searching
through it using binary search. What’s the maximum number of
steps it would take?
- log2(128) = 6

1.2 Suppose you double the size of the list. What’s the maximum
number of steps now?
- List = 128. double of list is 128 * 2 = 256
- log2(256) = 8
