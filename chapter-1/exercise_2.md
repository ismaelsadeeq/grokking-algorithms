Give the run time for each of these scenarios in terms of Big O.

* 1.3 You have a name, and you want to find the person’s phone number
in the phone book.

If the phone book is sorted you can use binary search which will give you
O(log(n))

* 1.4 You have a phone number, and you want to find the person’s name
in the phone book. (Hint: You’ll have to search through the whole
book!)

Use linear search giving you O(n)


* 1.5 You want to read the numbers of every person in the phone book.

Linerar search O(n)


* 1.6 You want to read the numbers of just the As. (This is a tricky one!
It involves concepts that are covered more in chapter 4. Read the
answer—you may be surprised!)

Linear Search O(n) because the phone book names might just be the all A's.
