EXERCISE
* 3.2 Suppose you accidentally write a recursive function that runs
forever. As you saw, your computer allocates memory on the
stack for each function call. What happens to the stack when your
recursive function runs forever?

* The stack memory will be filled up, and the program will run out of memory, which is called 
stackoverflow error.
